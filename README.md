# TDA367Project
Project in the course TDA367

The project aims to create a game of the genre "Roguelike". 

Our idea is that you progress in a 2-dimensional environment with a single character, going through different rooms in some kind of dungeon. On the way through the dungeon there will be enemies trying to stop you with possible platforming involved. At the end of the dungeon there will be some kind of boss creature.

The game will be pretty short but very difficult, and feature "permadeath" meaning that if your character dies, you lose all progress and have to start over. To make things more
interesting the map and gameplay is not the same every time you play (typical characteristics of a "Roguelike"). The map will be randomly generated or at least put different rooms in different orders so that you don't know what challenge is next. Enemies are also placed randomly.

There will be a great number of items changing the dynamics of combat and every time you find one it will be randomly generated.
